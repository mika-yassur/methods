    <p>1. This project is made up of a cartographic platform of Gaza, with layers of information that can be added and subtracted. </p>
    <p>The first and base layer visualizes <strong>infrastructures</strong> such as roads, municipalities, refugee camps, and border checkpoints. Further layers introduce temporal and movement-based phenomena; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <strong>Displacement</strong> layer shows the evacuation areas from different times in Israel’s siege, the established humanitarian zone; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Ground Invasion</strong> shows the extent of Israel’s ground invasion; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <strong>Urban Destruction</strong> layer shows the effects of bombing and invasion on the built environment; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure</strong> shows the locations of destroyed or damaged schools, universities, religious centers, government buildings, shelters, cultural centers, health facilities, and utilities; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <strong>Destruction of Road Network</strong> layer shows a network of damaged roads, as well as the slight to severe (or complete disconnection) increase in distance to hospitals, the evacuation corridor, and safe zone; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Destruction of Medical Infrastructure</strong> shows the status of hospitals and field hospitals, from reduced to no functioning, and hospitals directly under siege; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Destruction of Agriculture and Water Resources</strong> shows destruction of destroyed or damaged greenhouses, the extent of destroyed agricultural land, the extent of agricultural land in October 2023, overall flora in 2021, destroyed, intact, or damaged water tanks and wells, desalination plants, and WWTPs; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <strong>Targeting of Aid</strong> layer adds a more detailed timeline of specific attacks on aid convoys, aid personnel, civilians seeking aid, and on shelters, bakeries, and markets, while the map geolocates these attacks and shows the distribution of the types of targets; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, the <strong>Spatial Control</strong> layer shows newly imposed corridors limiting civilian movement both between north and south Gaza and to Egypt. 
</p>
Users can navigate this list of layers, toggling them on and off to visualize them on the map. A zoom feature on the map allows users to see Gaza holistically or focus on a certain region more granularly. At the bottom of the screen, an adjustable timeline allows users to scroll and see the evolution of a given layer over time, such as the extent of road damage or the spread of the ground invasion. 
</p>
    <p>On the right-hand side, users can access a spreadsheet of “incidents,” citing data points with hyperlinked evidence in the form of videos and watchdog sources. Finally, Forensic Architecture highlights some of their major points of analysis with supporting facts on an additional panel, identifying overarching patterns from the data they show.

    <p>2. At the time this was created, the Israel’s genocide in Gaza was committed for a little over a year. Forensic Architecture aimed to present the data they had collected not only in a visual format, but to demonstrate patterns and connections between types of violence and show the extent of the military’s destruction of “conditions necessary for life” in Gaza. As they write, their analyses “indicate a systematic and organised campaign to destroy life.” The interactive map they developed shows data across regions in Gaza, periods of time spanning pre-invasion and different phases of Israel’s offensive, and categories of events as detailed above. They aimed to “reveal trends within datasets and relationships between different datasets” and identity patterns that “may indicate that these attacks are designed, formally or informally, rather than occurring at random.” 
</p>
<p>Throughout Israel’s invasion of Gaza, debates continued to arise in mainstream media questioning whether Israel’s violence was “justified,” or even whether certain strikes were coming from the IDF or misfired Hamas rockets. (Forensic Architecture investigated the debate around al-Ahli hospital in Gaza city, for example, situating and analysing footage in Blender to demonstrate that the trajectory of the rocket came from the Israeli side). A year later, when A Cartography of Genocide was published, FA was able to demonstrate not only Israel’s bombing of multiple hospital and medical aid sites, but the destruction of so many avenues of essential infrastructure. This project demonstrates undeniable evidence of the scale of Israel’s and their severity over time. According to FA, these patterns correspond with definitions of genocide established by Raphael Lemkin—“a coordinated plan of actions aimed at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.” The multifaceted analysis performed by FA painfully demonstrates this trajectory.

    <p>3. In my view, this interface develops a powerful argument through its layering techniques to show the extent of damage on so many aspects of Gazan life. The interactive map uses a distinct visual language of color, pattern, and texture to show actions, events, and types of landscapes that is overall visually intuitive and engaging, with a descriptive key. The leftmost side bar organizes these layers thematically and allows users to toggle layers of visualization on and off, inherently creating stark “before and after” images. As more and more layers are activated, the map becomes overwhelmingly filled with overlapping color regions, textures, and points, creating a visceral sense of total bombardment. 
</p>
<p>This project comes from a long series of FA cartographic investigations, with many of their past projects focusing on Israeli state violence (including an assessment of visual material presented by the Israeli legal team at the ICJ, German arms export to Israel, and an investigation into Israel’s 2014 attacks in Gaza). One methodologically similar prior project includes their ‘Conquer and Divide’ web platform created in collaboration with B’Tselem, an Israeli NGO. This platform is similarly temporal and cartographic, visualizing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza following the 1967 war. The project also highlights various avenues of control through settlements, declaration of nature reserves, military seizure of land, agricultural land grabs, and more. This project similarly develops a layered visual language on the map to show the cumulative impact of these initiatives. 
</p>
<p>In contrast to ‘Conquer and Divide,’ Cartography of Genocide relies more on user interactivity in activating the layers of analysis. I believe that engaging users in this way involves them as researchers and pattern finders, as users can choose their own combinations of layers and discover relationships between them for themselves. In this way, this project is also a resource for further scholarship and public empowerment in naming these atrocities.
