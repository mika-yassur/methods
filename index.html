<div class="First-Layer"> 
    <p>1. This project is made up of a cartographic platform of Gaza, with layers of information that can be added and subtracted. </p>
    <p>The first and base layer visualizes infrastructures such as roads, municipalities, refugee camps, and border checkpoints. Further layers introduce temporal and movement-based phenomena; the Displacement layer shows the evacuation areas from different times in Israel’s siege, the established humanitarian zone; Ground Invasion shows the extent of Israel’s ground invasion; the Urban Destruction layer shows the effects of bombing and invasion on the built environment; Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure shows the locations of destroyed or damaged schools, universities, religious centers, government buildings, shelters, cultural centers, health facilities, and utilities; the Destruction of Road Network layer shows a network of damaged roads, as well as the slight to severe (or complete disconnection) increase in distance to hospitals, the evacuation corridor, and safe zone; Destruction of Medical Infrastructure shows the status of hospitals and field hospitals, from reduced to no functioning, and hospitals directly under siege; Destruction of Agriculture and Water Resources shows destruction of destroyed or damaged greenhouses, the extent of destroyed agricultural land, the extent of agricultural land in October 2023, overall flora in 2021, destroyed, intact, or damaged water tanks and wells, desalination plants, and WWTPs; the Targeting of Aid layer adds a more detailed timeline of specific attacks on aid convoys, aid personnel, civilians seeking aid, and on shelters, bakeries, and markets, while the map geolocates these attacks and shows the distribution of the types of targets; finally, the Spatial Control layer shows newly imposed corridors limiting civilian movement both between north and south Gaza and to Egypt. 
</p>
Users can navigate this list of layers, toggling them on and off to visualize them on the map. A zoom feature on the map allows users to see Gaza holistically or focus on a certain region more granularly. At the bottom of the screen, an adjustable timeline allows users to scroll and see the evolution of a given layer over time, such as the extent of road damage or the spread of the ground invasion. 
</p>
    <p>On the right-hand side, users can access a spreadsheet of “incidents,” citing data points with hyperlinked evidence in the form of videos and watchdog sources. Finally, Forensic Architecture highlights some of their major points of analysis with supporting facts on an additional panel, identifying overarching patterns from the data they show.
